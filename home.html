          <p>
            Tacos first appeared in the United States around 1905, brought by
            Mexican migrant workers who were hired for jobs in the mines and
            railroads in the Southwestern U.S. Initially considered a low-class
            street food, tacos were sold by women known as "Chili Queens".
